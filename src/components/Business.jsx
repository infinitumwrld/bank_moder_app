/*
CODE EXPLANATION:

This code defines a React functional component called "Business" that renders a section 
element with an ID of 'features' and a className of 'layout.section'. It imports an array 
called 'features' from a constants file, styles object and layout object from a separate 
file and imports a component called "Button" from another file.

The component also defines a functional component called 'FeatureCard' which takes in 
4 props, icon, title, content and index and renders a div element with a className of 
'flex flex-row p-6 menor rounded-[20px] mb-6 feature-card'. This div contains two child divs:

 1.The first div contains an image element with a src of icon and className of 'w-[50%] h-[50%] object-contain'
 2.The second div contains two child elements:
    *h4 element with className of 'font-poppins font-seminold text-white text-[18px] leading-[23px] mb-1' and displays the title prop
    *p element with className of 'font-poppins font-normal text-dimWhite text-[16px] leading-[24px] mb-1' and displays the content prop

The Business component maps over the features array and renders a FeatureCard component for each item in the array with all the properties of the current feature object.

The Business component has a structure with two main sections:
 1.A section on the left side with a heading and a paragraph and a button component
 2.A section on the right side with the FeatureCard components.

The component is exported as the default export, and when rendered, it will display a section with a heading and a paragraph, and a button component on the left side
